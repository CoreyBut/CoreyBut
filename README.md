### 💡 About Me

I'm practicing web development to sharpen my IT skillset. Right now, I'm learning:

- IT Infrastructure  
- Web Development (beyond basic HTML)  
- Mathematical problem solving  
- Effective communication skills  

In Web Dev, we’re building projects that use:
- **Semantic HTML**
- **Image & link layout**
- **Interactive elements**
- **Responsive design principles**

🌍 I'm from **Florence, AL** and volunteer with **Habitat for Humanity** a few times a year.  
One day, I’d love to build websites for local charities and nonprofits that need a hand.
